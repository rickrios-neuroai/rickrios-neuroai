Hi, I’m Rick

# Rick Ríos — Automation, Robotics & AI Engineer

Automation, robotics, and AI engineer focused on building intelligent industrial systems that enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability. My background spans industrial automation, robotics integration, and advanced control systems, with a strong emphasis on applying artificial intelligence to real-world plants, mining operations, and manufacturing environments. I am currently developing a next-generation edge AI platforms designed to act as intelligent nervous systems for industry and human assistance.

My current research centers on neural networks, edge AI, and emerging neuromorphic computing technologies, including spiking neural networks and neuroprocessors for ultra-low-power, real-time intelligence at the edge. I am particularly interested in hybrid systems that merge control theory, instrumentation, and AI to create self-adaptive, explainable, and safety-critical industrial intelligence. My mission is to advance benevolent AI infrastructure that protects workers, optimizes energy use, and supports humanity through intelligent automation.
